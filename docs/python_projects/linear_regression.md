# Linear regression

**Project status:** Active development  

This work is part of my first Rust project (see [here](../rust_projects/linear_regression.md)). The aim is to learn how to write Python bindings for Rust code.


## Roadmap
- [x] Write Python API wrapper for the Rust library crate.
- [x] Add CI pipeline for automatic publishing to PyPI.
