# Mendelian randomisaton (MR)

**Project status:** Active


## Roadmap
- [ ] **Theory**: Document the statistical foundations of Mendelian Randomization (MR), specifically focusing on summary-data genome-wide association studies (GWAS) frameworks.
- [ ] **Development**: Architect and implement a Python package for Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW) estimation.
- [ ] **Automation**: Configure a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment to PyPI.

## Theory
Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a method that leverages genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer causal relationships between exposures and outcomes in observational data. The core principle of MR is based on Mendel's laws of inheritance, which suggest that alleles are randomly assorted during gamete formation, thus mimicking the randomization process in controlled trials.
